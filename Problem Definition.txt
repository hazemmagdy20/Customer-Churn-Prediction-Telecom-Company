Telecom Company.

Goal: Predict if the Customer will leave (Churn) or no.

So that If:
        Churn = Yes  --> Customer will leave.
        Churn = No   --> Customer will continue.
        
Each column of Dataset represents a possible reason why a client might leave or prefer.

The Dataset columns are:

1️⃣ Customer ID
    Meaning: A unique ID for each customer
    Why is it there? For tracking purposes only.
    ML? ❌ Removed (has no predictive power)

2️⃣ Gender (Male / Female)
    Why is it there? Some companies analyze behavior based on gender.
    ML? Demographic Feature
    Its impact is often weak.  

3️⃣ Senior Citizen
    0 = Not very old
    1 = Senior citizen
    Why is this important?
        Older adults may: Prefer stability
        Or conversely: Use less technology
    It's a Binary numerical feature

4️⃣ Partner
    Is the client married/with a partner?
    Business logic:
        Those with a partner are generally more stable.
        Churn relat

5️⃣ Dependents
    Does he/she have children/dependents?
    Why?
        Family = Constant need for support
        Strong churn signal (sometimes)        

6️⃣ Tenure
    Number of months the customer has spent with the company
    One of the strongest features 🔥
    Logic:
        Low tenure → High churn
        Large tenure → Loyal customer
    Numerical feature (very important)

7️⃣ PhoneService
    Does he have mobile service? Yes / No
    Why? A customer who uses fewer services might leave faster.

8️⃣ Multiple Lines
    Does he have more than one line?
    Values: Yes / No / No phone service
    Feature reflects usage level

9️⃣ Internet Service
    Internet Type: DSL / Fiber optic / No
    Fiber optic is often:
        More expensive
        More problems
        Higher dataset churn

🔟 Online Security
    Are you subscribed to the online security add-on?
    Why?
        Add-ons = More connection with the company
        No → Higher churn

1️⃣1️⃣ Online Backup
    Backup service
    Same idea: More services = customer stickiness (loyality)

1️⃣2️⃣ Device Protection
    Device Protection
    Business: Customer who pays more → Less churn

1️⃣3️⃣ TechSupport
    Technical Support
    Very Important Feature
    No TechSupport → High churn

1️⃣4️⃣ Streaming TV
    Is Streaming TV being used?
    Lifestyle feature
    Reflects usage intensity مدي

1️⃣5️⃣ Streaming Movies
    Same idea
    Not a powerful feature on its own
    But it strengthens the model

1️⃣6️⃣ Contract
    Contract Type:
        Month-to-month ❌
        One year
        Two year ✅
    Top churn driver
    Month-to-month = Very high churn    

1️⃣7️⃣ Paperless Billing
    Electronic Billing?
    Related to User Behavior
    Digital users sometimes churn more

1️⃣8️⃣ Payment Methods
    Payment Methods:
        Electronic check ❌
        Credit card (automatic) ✅
        Bank transfer
        Mailed check
    Electronic check is linked to a high churn

1️⃣9️⃣ Monthly Charges
    Monthly Bill
    Logic: High charges → dissatisfaction → churn
    Numerical

2️⃣0️⃣ Total Charges
    Total amount paid by the customer
    Related to:
        Tenure
        Monthly Charges
    Useful but correlated feature
